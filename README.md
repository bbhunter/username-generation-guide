# OSINT Username generation guide

A definitive guide to generating usernames for OSINT purposes.

## Start

Let's find out your goals.

If I understand correctly, **you have some information about people**, and you want to **get a list of usernames** (nicknames), that's may be used to search for those people.

Am I right? So, you're in right place. 

Below you can read the information on how to get clues for a new search, starting from the data you know, as well as how to automate this and what tools to use.

### What do you have?

If you only have some information as a first name, a last name, a birthday (and, maybe some extra info), you should take a look at the section [“Combining primary info"](#combining-primary-info).

Do you need extra help to extend the number of likely usernames? For learning methods to get variants of first names and so on, check section [“Primary info mining”](#primary-info-mining).  

If you have a username and want to guess similar usernames, jump to the [“Username permutations”](#username-permutations) section.
