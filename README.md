# OSINT Username generation guide

A definitive guide to generating usernames for OSINT purposes.

## Start

Let's find out your goals.

If I understand correctly, **you have some information about people**, and you want to **get a list of usernames** (nicknames), that's may be used to search for those people.

Am I right? So, you're in right place.

Below you can read the information on how to get clues for a new search, starting from the data you know, as well as how to automate this and what tools to use.

### What do you have?

If you only have some information as a first name, a last name, a birthday (and, maybe some extra info), you should take a look at the section [“Combining primary info"](#combining-primary-info).

Do you need extra help to extend the number of likely usernames? For learning methods to get variants of first names and so on, check section [“Primary info mining”](#primary-info-mining).

If you have a username and want to guess similar usernames, jump to the [“Username permutations”](#username-permutations) section.

## Combining primary info

- Very useful interactive [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17URMtNmXfEZEW9oUL_taLpGaqTDcMkA79J8TRw4xnz8/edit#gid=0) for email permutations.

- Script [python-email-permutator](https://github.com/Satys/python-email-permutator) based on previous tool

- Alias generator mode of [OSRFramebork](https://github.com/i3visio/osrframework)

- Script based on ProtOSINT combination methods:

```sh
./generate_by_real_info.py
```
